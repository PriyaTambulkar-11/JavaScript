# JavaScript Practice Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript practice repository! 🎉  
This repository contains a collection of JavaScript exercises, projects, and examples that I’ve worked on to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and browser-based development.

## 📌 JavaScript Concepts 

This repository serves as a hands-on workspace for learning and applying core JavaScript concepts such as:

- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Conditional Statements
- Loops and Iterations
- Functions and Scope
- Arrays and Objects
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling
- Basic Projects (e.g., Calculator, To-Do App, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-practice-repo.git
   cd js-practice-repo
2. Open the HTML files in your browser or use a local server (like Live Server extension in VS Code) to run the examples.
3. Modify and experiment with the code to enhance your learning.

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals.
- Practice writing clean and reusable code.
- Build small interactive projects.
- Prepare for front-end and full-stack development roles.

## 📌 Future Plans
- Add more advanced concepts (ES6+, Fetch API, async/await, etc.).
- Create more interactive mini-projects.
- Include test cases for functions using Jest or other tools.
